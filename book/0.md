**Salute, Jonathan!** (Hello, Jonathan!) is the story of a young Englishman who goes to visit his friend in another European country. It is written entirely in the language Occidental (Interlingue), created by [Edgar de Wahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_de_Wahl) from Tallinn (Estonia) and published in 1922. It begins with very simple language. The first words in the book are Un mann sta in un cité (a man stands in a city), and it continues from there. The words the reader knows are repeated and new words are added slowly and in context, so that no dictionary is required to read it. The grammar of Occidental is very simple and straightforward, so that at the end of Salute, Jonathan! you will know how to read and use it.

The book is based on the Nature Institute's learning method used in books such as English by the Nature Method, Le français par la méthode nature, L'italiano secondo il metodo natura, and Hans Ørberg's Lingua Latina per se Illustrata.
