## Salute, Jonathan! The Occidental Language by the Direct Method

Salute, Jonathan! (Hello, Jonathan!) is the story of a young Englishman who goes to visit his friend in another European country...or so it would seem.

It is written entirely in the language [Occidental (Interlingue)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlingue), a language created by [Edgar de Wahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_de_Wahl) from Tallinn (Estonia) that he published in 1922. The book Salute, Jonathan! was written by [Mithridates](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Mithridates) and published on Wikibooks in 2019.

Salute, Jonathan! begins with very simple language. The first words in the book are Un mann sta in un cité (a man stands in a city), and it continues from there. The words the reader knows are repeated and new words are added slowly and in context, so that no dictionary is required to read it. Occidental was created to be an international language, with a very simple and straightforward grammar. Thanks to its simplicity and regularity, you will know how to read and use it by the end of Salute, Jonathan!.

The method in the book is based on the same used in books such as English by the Nature Method, Le français par la méthode nature, and L'italiano secondo il metodo natura, as well as Hans Ørberg's Lingua Latina per se Illustrata.

Curious about the true nature of the story in the book? You will begin to get clues as to the true story around Chapter 4 as the language becomes more and more complex and an actual story begins to form. Salute, Jonathan! is in fact a full translation of a classic book that you are likely very familiar with. Read on to find out!
