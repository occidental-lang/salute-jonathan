# Salute, Jonathan!

The main app for viewing the contents of the book is `index.html`.

## Contributing

### Book Text

Contributing to the book is simple. Just create a markdown file named `chapterNumber.md` and place it in `book/`.

Structure the chapter texts like so:

```markdown
## Chapter title

Chapter text

<span class="sidenote">This is an example of a sidenote.</span>

<span data-tippy-content="Hover-over text explanation note">This is an example of hover-over text.</span>

## Grammatica

This grammar text goes after the chapter text.
```

### Audio

Contributing to the audio is very simple for now, though this may change. Record an mp3 file and name it `chapterNumber.mp3` and place it in `audio/`.
